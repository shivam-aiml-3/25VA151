        Delhi Freezing Cold This Year: A Bitter Chill
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Delhi is experiencing an unusually cold winter this year, with temperatures dipping to record lows. Residents are facing an intense cold wave, and the chill is making everyday life a bit more challenging. The city, known for its scorching summer heat, is now gripped by a winter that feels colder than ever before.

    <h3>Weather Forecast:</h3>
    <p>This year, Delhi's minimum temperatures have been recorded at 4°C to 5°C over the past few days, which is colder than the usual winter averages. The cold wave is expected to persist for the next few weeks, with the coldest days likely occurring towards the end of December.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current Temperature (as of today):</b> 4°C</li>
        <li><b>Expected Low in the Coming Days:</b>3°C to 2°C</li>
        <li><b>Humidity:</b> High, making the cold feel even more intense</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Why is Delhi So Cold This Year?</h3>
    While Delhi experiences cold winters every year, the intensity of the chill this season has been particularly severe. Several factors are contributing to this unusually cold spell:
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Cold wave from the Himalayas</b></dt>
           <dd>Delhi’s location, with the Himalayas to the north, is directly impacted by cold air masses coming down from the mountains. This northwesterly winds bring extremely cold air from regions like Tibet and Central Asia, which causes the temperatures in Delhi to drop significantly. When this cold air meets the dense fog over the city, the conditions are intensified, leading to a severe cold wave.</dd>
        <dt><b>Persistent Fog and Low Visibility</b></dt>
           <dd>Delhi is experiencing a thick layer of fog this year, especially in the mornings. This fog is caused by high humidity and low temperatures. As fog traps the cold air close to the ground, it prevents sunlight from warming the city during the day, making the cold feel even more intense. The reduced sunlight also means that the city experiences colder nights.</dd>
        <dt><b>Delayed Sunlight due to Pollution</b></dt>
           <dd>Air pollution in Delhi has worsened over the years, and it’s playing a key role in trapping cold air. The smog and pollution act like a blanket, reflecting heat back towards the city and contributing to a reduction in the amount of warmth the city absorbs during the day. This results in colder temperatures both during the day and at night.</dd>
        <dt><b>La Niña Effect</b></dt>
           <dd>The La Niña phenomenon is another factor that affects weather patterns worldwide, including in India. La Niña leads to cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which can cause colder winters in northern India, including Delhi. The phenomenon has been linked to more intense cold waves and increased rainfall in the region.</dd>
